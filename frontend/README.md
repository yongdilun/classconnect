## API Integration

API integration is handled through service modules:

- **api.ts**: Base configuration for API requests
- **authService.ts**: Authentication-related API calls
- **classService.ts**: Class-related API calls
- **assignmentService.ts**: Assignment-related API calls

## Styling

The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling:

- Utility-first approach
- Custom theme configuration in `tailwind.config.js`
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Deployment

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

2. Deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your web server or hosting service.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Connection Issues**
   - Check that the backend server is running
   - Verify the `VITE_API_URL` in the `.env` file
   - Check browser console for CORS errors

2. **Authentication Problems**
   - Clear browser localStorage and try logging in again
   - Check that the JWT token is being properly stored and sent

3. **Build Issues**
   - Check for TypeScript errors
   - Verify that all dependencies are installed
   - Clear the node_modules folder and reinstall dependencies
```
